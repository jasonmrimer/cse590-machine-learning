## Objectives
1. Build and analyze simple regression algorithms based on KNN and linear models
2. Identify cases of underfitting and overfitting
3. Select parameters that optimize performance (generalization)

## Problems
For this problem, you will use the Wine Quality database (posted in Blackboard). Use the provided training data subset to train your model and the testing subset to predict and analyze your results.

### KNN
Build and train a KNN Regression model. Vary the parameter K and analyze the results by identifying cases of overfitting and underfitting. Select the optimal value of K.
